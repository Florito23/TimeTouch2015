-- Organized getting of segments from storage ---

In LineStorage, change getSegmentsAtTime to return 
an array of Vector of SegmentVO, based on their parent Line.
That way we can actually draw begin and end caps.

The current caps actually just tell the first and last point of a line.
Not really relevant. We might actually remove this. Or reuse it for the segment getter of the LineStorage



--- AbstractCanvas ---

A canvas that does not extend any display object, but that provides methods for drawing.
